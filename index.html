                <p>It's a big world out there,<br />
                With an expanding sky that We can dare,<br />
                Spread your wings, and soar the sky,<br />
                Because <b>You</b> were born to fly.<br /></p>

                <p>May turbulence not affect your journey,<br />
                May bad frequencies not come your way,<br />
                May the Sun shine brightly on <b>You</b> today,<br />
                As you fly that Learjet someday.</p>

                <p>Happy birthday to my best buddy, brother,<br />
                and an amazing friend.<br />
                I know you are getting older, but it's okay.<br />
                I will reach that age someday.<br />
                Cherish the moments that we are going to have in the future. I know they are going to be epic.<br />

It is so easy to tell you everything especially knowing you won't judge (much) and overreact (much). MOAR OF ADI JOSH CHILL SESSION NEEDS TO HAPPEN.</p>
